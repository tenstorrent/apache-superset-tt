"""increase_llm_api_key_length

Revision ID: b1c2d3e4f5g6
Revises: a1b2c3d4e5f6
Create Date: 2026-02-04 12:00:00.000000

This migration increases the api_key column length in the llm_connection table
from VARCHAR(100) to TEXT and sets nullable=True to accommodate longer API keys
from providers like Anthropic and OpenAI, which often exceed 100 characters, and
to align the database schema with the model definition.
